# Flowizi

Flowizi is a CLI app that automates the process of opening all the tools you need for your workflow

### Key features

- Automatically open all websites, meetings, files or apps that are part of your workflow with a single command
- Add and join meetings without having to open a browser manually
- Start recording the screen after joining a meeting and storing the video locally

### Installation

To download Flowizi, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/jeangiraldoo/flowizi/releases) section of this repository and download the .exe for the latest release (or the release you prefer) in the assets section. At the moment there's no release for MacOS or Linux, but stay tuned!

The .exe file behaves like a script. You need to move it to the directory where you want it to reside. Once it's there, you can run it using the terminal.
